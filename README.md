  #CMD-->pip install npm           (ONCE per localhost offline, make sure your in correct folder.)
  #CMD-->npm install      
  #CMD-->heroku local web
  
You can use both npm and Heroku to run localhost, even liveserver on VSC if you dare...
I recommend which ever goes live first, don't ask me why which one cause that would be too much iron for the cast, just joking, don't make me get the big guns.

The recommendations are to make sure your a reader & proactive user when it comes to writing.
