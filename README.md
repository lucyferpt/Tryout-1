#### 1. Get your HEROKU account				             
###  2. When is the best time to plant a tree?  
##   3. Answer further bellow!				              
#    4. This is what you need to get started     


- [step1] Create a <a href="https://signup.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku account</a> (Make sure to set your primary language as "Node")
- [step2] Download and install <a href="https://toolbelt.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku's command line tools</a>
- [step3] Create a <a href="https://github.com/join" target="_blank">GitHub account</a>
- [step4] Create a <a href="https://github.com/join](https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">Learn commands... or download Github Desktop</a>
- [step5] Download and install <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#setting-up-git" target="_blank">git (GitHub's command line tool)</a>
- [step6] Download and install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>
- [step7] Download and install a text editor (we recommend <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>)
Use Google to search for any error messages you receive when installing the tools. Google is a great resource to get through roadblocks like these.

Remember to patch up relevant pieces of information and build your own apps, eventualling your rolling version will be past staging, publishing is up to you!
# ***********************************************************
#  Heroku/NPM Local Web Relevant Commands By Order
  #CMD-->heroku create (Keep track of your apps on Heroku.com, only need one to start with.. Use Heroku restart/ Heroku restart -a $appname for closure.)
  #CMD-->pip install npm           (ONCE per time localhost goes offline, make sure your in correct folder.)
  #CMD-->heroku local web

If you get a 'cannot get' error, restart the local host, only has been set up using initial DOM.
  
You can use both npm and Heroku to run localhost, even liveserver on VSC if you dare...  
I recommend which ever goes live first, don't ask me why which one cause that would be too much iron for the cast, just joking..  
Don't make me get the big guns.

The recommendations are to make sure your a reader & proactive user when it comes to writing..  
Oh and use Github Desktop if you want to avoid training your CMD Skills.

  Your app should be running on port 5000.
